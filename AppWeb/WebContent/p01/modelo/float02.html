This specification defines Cascading Style Sheets, level 2 revision 1 (CSS 2.1). CSS 2.1 is a style sheet language that allows authors and users to attach style (e.g., fonts and spacing) to structured documents (e.g., HTML documents and XML applications). By separating the presentation style of documents from the content of documents, CSS 2.1 simplifies Web authoring and site maintenance.
CSS 2.1 builds on CSS2 [CSS2] which builds on CSS1 [CSS1]. It supports media-specific style
 sheets so that authors may tailor the presentation of their documents to visual browsers, 
 aural devices, printers, braille devices, handheld devices, etc.

WebFonts is a technology that enables people to use fonts on demand over the Web 
without requiring installation in the operating system. W3C has experience in
 downloadable fonts through HTML, CSS2, and SVG. Until recently, downloadable fonts 
 have not been common on the Web due to the lack of an interoperable font format. 
 The WebFonts effort plans to address that through the creation of an industry-
 supported, open font format for the Web (called "WOFF").
